## My Ideas on Wyvern

### Language Evolution issue
As I described in my PS, when I try to improve the syntax model of a complex general language, we always met the grammar conflict issue. This is mainly because in a general language, the grammar was defined in a global space and grammar element couple with each other tightly. This kind of couple will made a language's grammar hard to change. I think this issue is common among different general language. However, with the advent of Wyvern, we have a new way to handle this situation! 

### Language Decomposition.
I think a good example for language 


### Wyvern as a language building tool

### syntax enhancement

### AOP support
